### Base pay range

$130,000.00/yr - $238,000.00/yr

**About Us**We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.  
  
We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Plaid, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.  
  
Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).  
  
**About The Role**Notion's Growth Engineers make our mission of software ubiquity a reality. Using experiments, creativity, and feature creation, this team accelerates the value of Notion to an ever growing audience of users. We are owners of the ins and outs of our business, using a blend of data, qualitative research, and product intuition to accelerate our impact at this critical time in our company’s journey.  
  
**What You'll Achieve**

* Deliver experiments end-to-end, from ideation to analysis, with velocity and quality to move core business metrics
* Get to know the Notion customer to understand key points in the customer journey and uncover insights that will drive activation and engagement
* Plan, shape, and build new features to create a more engaging and personalized early product experience for our customers

**Skills You'll Need To Bring**

* Shipping polished user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience. You have experience and are comfortable using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.
* Data and experimentation: You have Growth Engineering experience at another company. You are comfortable iteratively testing product flows using A/B testing to understand customer behavior and make data-informed decisions.
* Thoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
* Pragmatism and impact-orientation: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
* Putting users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.

**Nice To Haves**

* A history of strong cross-functional collaboration with marketing, sales, and/or other non-technical teams
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.  
  
Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation made due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.  
  
Notion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco, the estimated base salary range for this role is $130,000 - $238,000 per year.  
  
By clicking “Submit Application”, I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion’s Global Recruiting Privacy Policy.
